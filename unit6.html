<h3>Unit 6: Data Structures and scientific computing tools in Numpy
</h3>

<div>
  So far we have looked at some of the basic aspects of the python
  language.  Python in itself does not contain many functions required
  for performing mathematical calculations, or creating
  matrices. There are pieces of python code that have been created for
  performing scientific calculations. In this course we will focus on
  one package in particular: <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">
  numpy</a>, for which there is a &quotquickstart&quot
  tutorial <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html">here</a>. You
  might also like to read <a href=
  "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/python-for-scientists/E5CBE088065279A607A18673622AD89D">Chapter
  4</a> in Python for Scientists that gives an alternative
  introduction to numpy. We will go over the main points of the usage
  of numpy in this unit.
</div>
<div> Often, in a physical problem, we might want one object to be
  represented by many numbers - e.g. the components of a vector or the
  displacement of a taut string at various points along its length, or
  we might just want to collect related data together, such as
  multiple measurements in an experiment.  We could define a variable
  with a different name for each value we wish to store, but a neater
  solution is to use an <i>array</i>. This is a basic object in Numpy
  -- the ndarray. It contains multiple objects <strong>all of the same
  data type</strong> (i.e. integers, complex numbers, floating point
  numbers ...).
<br>
  We can create an array for the spatial point (x,y,z) = (3,4,5) as
  follows.
  </div>

<pre>
<code>
import numpy as np

r_coordinate = np.array([3,4,5])
print("r_coordinate is: ", r_coordinate)
print("r_coordinate is of type ", type(r_coordinate))
</code>
</pre>

<div>
There are a few things to notice here: first we import the numpy
package and give it an abbreviation (<code>np</code> by
convention). This will reduce typing to use numpy functions, and make
our code more readable. Then we create an array by
passing <code>np.array</code> a list of the components. We can
investigate the new object by again using the <code>type</code>
function -- the result is numpy.ndarray. Numpy includes many more
functions which you can see by typing <code>np.</code> and then tab to
see a list of completions in ipython3 (alternatively you can
use <code>dir(np)</code> to list the available functions in the
package). You can also look up a particular function by using
the <code>np.lookfor()</code> function. For example you might like to
look for functions to help with square root: <code> np.lookfor('square
root')</code>. You can look at the documentation for a numpy function
using help e.g. <code>help(np.sqrt)</code>. This will give you details
of the usage of a particular function.

</div>

<div>
There are many different ways to create a numpy array. Some examples
of these are given in the code below.
  </div>
<pre>
<code>
import numpy as np
#list converted to an array, specifying the type
list_array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype = int)
list_array2 = np.array([1.5, 2.5, 3], dtype = float)

#two dimensional array from a list
twod_array = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])

#array of zeros with a tuple defining the shape
array_a = np.zeros( (5, 27), dtype = float )

#array of ones with a tuple defining the shape
array_b = np.ones( (3,5), dtype = int )

#an empty array where the elements are not initialised
array_c = np.empty( (2,2) )
</code>
</pre>

<div>
When we come to creating plots it will be useful to have an array of
equally spaced points to define the intervals on the axes. If we want
to make a list of points from 0 to 10 with spacing 0.1 there are a few
different ways of doing this shown below.

<pre>
  <code>
import numpy as np

#List comprehension converted to an array
xvalues1 = np.array([x*0.1 for x in range(101)])

#arange works much like range. Note we need to extend the stop value to include the end point
xvalues2 = np.arange(start = 0, stop = 10.01, step = 0.1)

#linspace creates a set number of points (num) including the endpoint
xvalues3 = np.linspace(start = 0, stop = 10, num = 101, endpoint = True)
  </code>
</pre>
</div>


<div>
Now that we have an array we can select components of the array, or
array slices in the same way that we did for lists. The array indexing
again starts from 0.
<pre>
  <code>
import numpy as np

#create an array to work with
array1 = np.array([x for x in range(101)], dtype = float)

#Print out the first component with a field width 5, and 2 decimal places
print("%5.2f" % array1[0])

#a slice of the first 10 elements
print(array1[0:10])

#a slice of the last 2 elements
print(array1[-1:])
  </code>
</pre>
Remember that if we use negative indices then we are counting from the
end of our array, just as with lists. If we omit a component of the
slice then it refers to the first element if it is before the :, or
the last element if it is at the end. We have used
the <code>print</code> command to format the output of our
operations. You can read more about the syntax of this
command <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_formatted_output.php">
here</a>. Essentially we have specified that we want a floating point
number <code>f</code>, with <code>5</code> characters , <code>2</code>
of which appear after the decimal place.
</div>
<div>
Another way to select elements in a numpy array is by using an array
of logical values -- True if we wish to select the element and False
if we wish to omit them. This is a great way to filter an array for
just the components that we are interested in. For example:
<pre>
  <code>
import numpy as np

#initialise our array of integers again
array1 = np.array([x for x in range(101)], dtype = float)

#create a logical array to select only those elements greater than 20
array2 = array1>20

#use the array of logical values to select the values we want
array1[array2]

#We can do this in one line
array1[array1>20]
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<div>
  We can work with the values in an array by using a loop as follows:

  <pre>
    <code>
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([x for x in range(100)], dtype = float)

#loop over values of array
for element in array1:
    print("Value :", element)

#alternatively we can use create an iterator and then loop over all elements
for element in np.nditer(array1):
    print("Value :", element)

#this works for 2-d arrays as well
#first we create a 2-d array
array2 = array1.reshape((10,10))

#now loop over all the elements in the array
for element in np.nditer(array2):
    print("Value :", element)
    </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
  We could perform operations on each element of the array and store
  the result, but generally it is usually more efficient to try and
  work with the whole array at once, i.e. use vectorised code. For
  example if we want to create a plot of some common functions we
  could proceed as follows:

  <pre>
    <code>
import numpy as np

#values for x axis
xvalues1 = np.array([x*0.1 for x in range(101)])

#values for y axis for y = x**2
yvalues1 = xvalues1**2

#values for y axis for y = x* sin(x)
yvalues2 = xvalues1 * np.sin(xvalues1)
    </code>
    </pre>

</div>



<div>
  There are many other functions included in numpy that you might like
  to investigate. Some examples are given below.
  <pre>
    <code>
import numpy as np

sequence = np.array([1.0/x for x in range(101)])

print("The sequence sum is :", np.sum(sequence))

print("The sequence average is : ", np.average(sequence))

print("The sequence variance is : ", np.var(sequence))
      
    </code>
  </pre>
  </div>
