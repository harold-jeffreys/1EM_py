<h3>Unit 8: I/O
</h3>


<div>
  Now that you can perform some calculations it may be important to
  store the results by writing them to a file (a more permanent storage, so we can keep the data after turning off the computer). Similarly you might
  need to input some initial conditions by reading them from the user,
  or from a data file. You have already met the <code>input</code>
  function for getting information from the user in earlier exercises. We
  will now look at opening files to read and write your data.
</div>

<h4>Reading and Writing a file</h4>
<div>
  You can open a file using the built-in <code>open</code> function
  available in python. The program below shows how to open a file, and
  write to it.
</div>
<pre>
  <code>
#first we create a file object 
file_object = open("outputfile.txt", "w")
#This writes a string to the file, and then a new line using the special character \n
file_object.write("Hello, World\n")
#It is good practice to close the file after you have finished
file_object.close()
  </code>
</pre>

<div>
  When we use the open command we must specify what we plan to do with
  the file -- read <code>r</code>, write <code>w</code>, or append <code>a</code>
  to add new content to an existing file. The open command returns an
  file object that we can later use the write when we wish to output
  to it. We can read in data from the file we just created in a
  similar way.
</div>

<pre>
  <code>
file_object = open("outputfile.txt", "r")
line = file_object.readline()
print(line)
file_object.close()
  </code>
</pre>

<div>
  Sometimes it is difficult to know how much data there is in a
  particular file. In this case we need use a loop to read the data
  until the file is finished. The <code>readline</code> command returns an
  empty string if there is nothing more to be read from a file. This
  makes it easy to loop over a file as follows.
</div>

<pre>
  <code>
#first we will write a series of numbers to our file
file_object = open("outputfile2.txt", "w")

for x in range(0,10):
    file_object.write(str(x) + ", " + str( x**2)+"\n")

file_object.close()

#Now open the file for reading
file_object = open("outputfile2.txt", "r")

line = file_object.readline()
while line != "":
    #print current line
    print(line)
    #get the next line
    line = file_object.readline()

file_object.close()
  </code>
    
</pre>

<div>
  In this program we first write out the squares of the numbers 0 to 9
  using a for loop. We then reopen the same file for reading, and keep
  reading each line until the file is empty, and printing out the
  result. An alternative way to do the same operation is via a for
  loop as follows.
</div>

<pre>
  <code>
file_object = open('outputfile2.txt', 'r')
for line in file_object:
    print(line)
file_object.close()
  </code>
</pre>

<div>
  Or we can do the same loop using <code>with</code>, which will close our
  file for us afterwards.
  </div>
<pre>
  <code>
with open('outputfile2.txt', 'r') as file_object:
for line in iter(file_object.readline,'' ):
    print(line)

  </code>
</pre>


<h4>Reading and writing data using numpy</h4>
<div>
  If we have our data in a numpy array, then there are a few different
  ways we can write it to a file. We may want to produce a file that is
  readable by another program (e.g. for plotting), or by a user with a
  text editor. As a first example suppose we want to output a table of
  the squares of integers to a file. We could do this as follows:
  <pre>
    <code>
import numpy as np

#Create the data to write out
intarray = np.array([x for x in range(101)], dtype = int)
insqr = intarray ** 2

#open the file for writing, and put in a title
file_object = open("squares.dat", "w")
file_object.write("The squares of the first one hundred integers are:\n\n")

#loop over the arrays and write them to the file
for a, b in zip(intarray, insqr):
     file_object.write("%d squared is %d\n" % (a,b))

#close the file now we have finished
file_object.close()
    </code>
  </pre>
  Note here that we have used our formatted print statement, and the special
  character <code>\n</code> for a new line. The zip function is used here to
  combine the two arrays, so we can loop over them simultaneously.
</div>


<div>
  Now to read the file back in we can recover the sum of squares as follows:
  <pre>
    <code>
import numpy as np

file_object = open("squares.dat", "r")

#empty lists for the results in the file
fintegers = []
fsquares = []

#read the first two lines that contain no data
file_object.readline()
file_object.readline()

#now read each line into a list, and take the elements we need
for line in file_object:
   words = line.split()
   fintegers.append(int(words[0]))
   fsquares.append(int(words[3]))

#close the file
file_object.close()

#convert the lists to numpy arrays
intarray = np.array(fintegers, dtype = int)
sqrarray = np.array(fsquares, dtype = int)
    </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
  If we want to save, or load a numpy array to/from a file, then
  the numpy package has several utilities to do this much more easily.
  Some examples are below.
<pre>
  <code>
import numpy as np
#create some data to write to a file
sqrarray = np.array([x**2 for x in range(101)], dtype = int)
cubearray = np.array([x**3 for x in range(101)], dtype = int)
fourtharray = np.array([x**4 for x in range(101)], dtype = int)

#save the three arrays to a file (look at this file in a text editor!)
np.savetxt('powers.dat', (sqrarray, cubearray, fourtharray))

#load them into new arrays (check the result!)
newsqr, newcube, newfourth = np.loadtxt('powers.dat')

#This method outputs a binary file -- check if you can read it in a text editor
np.save('squares.npy',sqrarray)

#We can reload the array from the file
newsqr2 = np.load('squares.npy')
  </code>
</pre>
</div>
<div>
  Here we use the <code>genfromtxt</code> function to read in the data
  from the comma separated variable (csv) file. We can then manipulate
  the data and reprocess it, or to plot it for example.
<pre>
  <code>
import numpy as np

squares = np.genfromtxt("outputfile2.txt", delimiter=",")

print(squares)

x_coordinate = squares[:,0]
y_coordinate = squares[:,1]
print(x_coordinate)
print(y_coordinate)
    
  </code>
</pre>
If you find yourself reading and writing lots of data files, then you
might try looking at some other python packages for data analysis such
as <a href = "http://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>.
