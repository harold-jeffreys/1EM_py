<H2>Exercise 9: Algorithms</H2>
</P>


<P>
Make sure you have read unit 9 before attempting the following exercise.
</P>

<h4>1 - Projectile</h4>
<div>
Write a program to calculate the trajectory of an object. The object
is located at the origin at <code>t=0</CODE>.  The initial $x$- and
$y$-components of the velocity should be entered at the keyboard.  You
can set the acceleration in the $x$-direction to be zero, and in the
$y$-direction to be $-9.8\textrm{ms}^{-2}$ within the body of your
program.  Your program should calculate the x and y positions of the
object every $0.01$s for $1000$ time steps.
</div>

<div>
The object will move according to Newton's laws, but we will (later)
have a non-constant acceleration so the &quot;suvat&quot; equations
don't apply. However, what we can do is use these equations and apply
them many times over successive tiny time intervals (as you saw in
exercise 5) over which we can assume the acceleration is constant.
The length of the small time interval can be made larger or smaller
depending on how accurately we want the answer.
</div>
Newton's equations of motion are
</div>

<P>
<code class="bluecolor"> x_new = x + ux*tint + 0.5*ax*(tint**2) </CODE><BR>
<code class="bluecolor"> ux_new = ux + ax*tint </CODE><BR>
</P>

<P>
where <code class="bluecolor">x_new</CODE> is the new value
of <code class="bluecolor">x</CODE> at a
time <code class="bluecolor">tint=0.01</CODE> seconds
later.  <code class="bluecolor">ux</CODE>, <code class="bluecolor">uy</CODE>, <code class="bluecolor">ax</CODE>
and <code class="bluecolor">ay</CODE> are the velocity components and
acceleration components respectively.  You should use these equations
(and equivalent ones in the $y$ direction) at each time step to update
the coordinates and velocity components.
</P>
<P>
Your program should ensure that only positive values of <CODE>ux</CODE>
and <CODE>uy</CODE> are entered. You will need to use one or more <B> if
...</B> statements here.  Arrange for your program to stop
(i.e. <code>break</code> out of the loop) as soon as <CODE>y</CODE> is less
than zero (we don't want our object burrowing through the ground!).
</P>

<div>
Plan your program first on paper either as a flow chart or in
pseudocode. Think about the order in which you need to do things, and
the quantities you need to calculate.
</div>

<H4>Program extensions</H4>
</P>

<P>
Now let's assess the effect of air resistance.  Have the $x$ component
of acceleration, <CODE>ax</CODE>, dependent on <CODE>ux</CODE>.  For
example<CODE>ax = -0.05*ux</CODE>.  This is an easy extension.

<P>
Try to get your object to bounce!  In other words, as soon
as <CODE>y</CODE> is less than zero, change <CODE>uy</CODE> to be
positive.  Halve the values of <CODE>ux</CODE> and <CODE>uy</CODE>
after a bounce.  This is not so easy to implement.
</P>


<BR><BR>
<P>

<B>DOES YOUR PROGRAM WORK?</B><BR>  Test your program by putting both
the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> components of the initial
velocity equal to $10$ m/s, and do not have air resistance.  Find the
total distance travelled before the object first strikes the ground.
The answer should be close to

<P>
$20.4$ m
</P>

<P>
Now put <code>ax = -0.05*ux</code> as wind resistance.  Show that the
total distance travelled before the object strikes the ground is now
</P>

<P>
$19.4$ m
</P>

<P>
When you are ready you should progress to <a href="unit10.html"> unit
10</a>.
