<h3>Unit 4: Loops.
</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
So far, our example programs have executed each line in turn through the program until the end of the program is reached. Sometimes it is useful to be able to go back and use the same parts of code over and over (e.g. with a new value of a variable). Fortunately, Python provides us very convenient ways of repeating code : <strong>Loops</strong>.</p>

<p> Before introducing the syntax of loops, let's take a simple example we will try to code in different ways. Let's imagine we want to get all the even numbers between 0 and 10 and put them in a list. How should we do this ? A very basic way would be : </p>

<pre><code>even_numbers = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(even_numbers)
</code></pre>

<p> This works perfectly as long as we know in advance that we want to go from 0 to 10. If we extend the exercise, and want to generate a list that will hold all even numbers from a value <code>a</code> to a value <code>b</code>, both entered by the user. How should we do ? You see that we cannot <strong>hardcode</strong> (ie, enter them manually) the values of the list anymore. Fortunately, loops are here to help us.</p>

<hr>

<h4>The <code>while</code> statement</h4>
<p>
  The simplest type of loop is a <code>while</code> loop. This type of loop will execute code while a certain condition is met. The condition is, as we have seen in the previous unit, a boolean expression. One execution of the loop is called an <strong>iteration</strong>. The general form of a <code>while</code> statement will thus be :
</p>

<pre><code>while condition:
    do_something
    do_more_things
    etc.
</code></pre>

<p>We can now translate our example and have a functional even number generator :</p>

<pre><code>even_numbers = [] # Initialisation

a = input('Enter the value of a :')
b = input('Enter the value of b :')

# We keep track of which number we have viewed previously, using a counter variable i.
i=a

# We check that a is even, if not we add 1 to i
if a%2 == 1:
   i=i+1    
    
while i <= b: # We iterate while we are under (or equal to) b
   even_numbers.append(i) # Adding i to the even number list
   i=i+2	              # Going to the next even number
	  
print(even_numbers)</code></pre>

<p>As for <code>if</code> statements, the code inside the <code>while</code> statement must be indented so that Python recognizes which code belongs to the loop and which code does not.</p>

<p>Let's push the example a little bit further. Now we have a list <code>even_numbers</code>, imagine if we wanted to make another list holding the squared values of each value in <code>even_numbers</code>. Using <code>while</code> statement, we would do :</p>

<pre><code>square_values = []
i = 0
while i < len(even_numbers):
   square_values.append(even_numbers[i]**2)
   i=i+1
	  
print(square_values)</code></pre>

<p>Let's break it down. First we initialise <code>i</code> to <code>0</code>. This variable will not account for a general position in the list. So it will go from <code>0</code> to <code>len(even_numbers)-1</code> included. So if we have four elements in <code>even_numbers</code>, <code>i</code> will take the values 0, 1, 2, 3. This is exactly what we are testing in the condition : as long as <code>i</code> is smaller than the size of the list, we keep going, and during each iteration, we add 1 to <code>i</code> (<code>i=i+1</code>). Then, for each iteration, we take the current even number (<code>even_number[i]</code>), square it (<code>**2</code>) and store it in <code>square_values</code>.</p>

<p>This is very convenient, but a bit long to write. Fortunately, we have another way to write this : <code>for</code> loops </p>

<hr>
	  
<h4>The <code>for</code> statement</h4>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements"><code>for</code></a> statements are loops just like <code>while</code> statements, but instead of iterating until a certain condition becomes false, these loops iterate on the values of a list. Let's take a very simple example to see what we mean :</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [1, 3, 9, 10, 'a', 'b', 7.5]

for value in my_list:
  print(value)</code></pre>

<p>If we execute this piece of code, we should end up with 7 lines of result, each one with the value of an element of <code>my_list</code>. The <code>for</code> statement will create a temporary variable that you can use inside the loop. More, generally, <code>for</code> statements are writtent :</p>

<pre><code>for variable in enumerable:
  do_something</pre></code>

<p>The variable will automatically take the type of what is stored in the enumerable. Note that we indicated <code>enumerable</code> and not <code>list</code> this is because you can use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate on the element of any enumerable : a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a string, etc.</p>
 
<p>Thanks to <code>for</code> loops, we can directly use the values of our list <code>even_numbers</code> in the loop statement. Let's rework our squared numbers example :</p>

<pre><code>square_values = []

for value in even_numbers:
  square_values.append(value**2)

print(square_values)</code></pre>

<p>This is a lot shorter !</p>

<p>As said before, for loops can iterate on anything : a list, a tuple, a dictionary or even a string. Try running the following lines :</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for v in my_list:
    print(v)
    
my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
for v in my_tuple:
    print(v)

my_dict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}
for v in my_dict:
    print(v, my_dict[v])

my_str = 'hello'
for v in my_str:
    print(v)</code></pre>

<p>One interesting thing is that we can iterate on multiple objects at the same time. For instance, imagine we have a list of couples :</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [(1, 2),
    (3, 4),
    (5, 6),
    (7, 8)]

for v in my_list:
    # We assign v[0] to a, v[1] to b
    a, b = v 
    print(b, a) 

# This loop will do exactly the same
for a, b in my_list:
    print(b, a)</code></pre>

<p>But what if we want something simpler, as iterating on a serie of increasing integers as <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...</code> ? Fortunately for us, Python provides us with a few very useful functions we can use to make our lives simpler </p>

<hr>

<h4>The <code>range</code> function</h4>

<p>The first function we are going to see that can help us is the <code>range</code> function. <code>range</code> allows us to construct a "list" (it is actually not really a list, but behaves as such in a for loop). There are three ways to use the <code>range</code> function : </p>

<pre><code>range(end)
range(start, end)
range(start, end, step)</code></pre>    

<p>In the first form, <code>range</code> will build a list that will span from <code>0</code> to <code>end</code> excluded. Hence, running a for loop on <code>range(4)</code> will iterate on the values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>The second form will allow you to provide a starting value (included). For instance <code>range(2, 5)</code> will span : <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the last form allows to specify a step size if you want to iterate differently. For instance, <code>range(2, 8, 2)</code> will span : <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>. You can also use a step size of <code>-1</code> to iterate in reverse order. Thus, <code>range(4, 0, -1)</code> will yield : <code>4</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Let's use this in an example and try to recode our base example : getting the square of all even numbers between two values provided by the user. This should be simple now that we have the <code>range</code> function :</p>

<pre><code>a = input('Enter the value of a :')
b = input('Enter the value of b :')

if a%2 == 1:
    a=a+1

squares = []
    
for value in range(a, b+1, 2):
    squares.append(value**2)

print(squares)</code></pre>

<p>Note that we use <code>b+1</code> in the range because the end value is excluded. We use a step of <code>2</code> to jump from an even value to the next.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Other builtin functions</h4>

<p>Just as the <code>range</code> function, there are two other functions we can use to make things simpler : <code>zip</code> and <code>enumerate</code>.</p>

<p><code>zip</code> is going to "glue" two lists together. These list can then be used in a for loop as we have seen previously :</p>

<pre><code>list_1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
list_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for a, b in zip(list_1, list_2):
    print(a, b)</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>zip function</code> allows you to concentrate on the objects you wish to iterate on, instead of having to iterate on a range of indices and extract each object manually.</p>

<p><code>enumerate</code> is a function that creates a zipped list with indices from a parameter. It is generally used to iterate on objects while keeping track of their indices. For instance, imagine you have a list of strings and want, for each element of the list, to print its value as well as its index in the list. The naive solution is to do :</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ['hello', 'how', 'are', 'you ?']
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    print(i, my_list[i])</code></pre>

<p><code>enumerate</code> makes things simpler :</p>
<pre><code>my_list = ['hello', 'how', 'are', 'you ?']
for i, value in enumerate(my_list):
    print(i, value)</code></pre>

<hr>
<h4>List comprehensions</h4>

<p>The last thing we will see in this unit are <strong>list comprehensions</strong>. Comprehensions are a general term in Python denoting a way of creating and initializing data structures in a very dense way.</p>

<p>Imagine we have a list <code>list_a</code> filled with integers and we want to initialise another list <code>list_b</code> that will hold the square of all the values in <code>list_a</code>. Up until now, we would create this list using a <code>for</code> loop :</p>

<pre><code>list_b = []
for value in list_a:
    list_b.append(value**2)</code></pre>

<p>List comprehensions allow us to write all of this in a single line :</p>

<pre><code>list_b = [value**2 for value in list_a]</code></pre>

<p>The general anatomy of a list comprehension is the following :</p>

<pre><code>result = [expression for element in base_list]</code></pre>

<p>Comprehensions are a general concept in Python and are not limited to lists but also apply to tuples or dictionaries. For instance, the following expressions are valid comprehensions :</p>
<pre><code>my_tuple = tuple(x+y for x, y in zip(list_a, list_b)) # We have to explicity mention we want a tuple for this.
my_dict = {i : v for i, v in enumerate(list_a)}</code></pre>

<p>Comprehensions are not easy to write at first but save a lot of time when mastered. You can practice writing list comprehensions versions of previous examples of this unit. Finally, you can also add conditions to list comprehensions to make them more complex. For instance, if we wanted to construct <code>list_b</code> in such a way that we would only store squares of even values of <code>list_a</code> we could write :</p>

<pre><code>list_b = [value**2 for value in list_a if value%2 == 0]</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you have read, coded and understood all of the above. Then try to solve the <a href="exercise4.html">exercises</a>.</p>
