<h2>Exercise 3: Conditions</h2>
</p>
<div>
<p>
Make sure you have read unit 3 before attempting the following exercises.
</p>


<h3>1 - Boolean values</h3>

<p>
  Copy paste the following code in a script, and complete every [???]
  by <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. If your guesses are
  correct, when you run the code, it should indicate that you have no
  error. Parentheses have been added so there is no ambiguity on the
  priority of the operations.
</p>

<pre><code>a = True
b = False
c = True
d = False

### Question 1 :
# Replace [???] by the value of (a or b). Try to guess instead of running the code.
q1 = ((a or b) == [???])
q2 = ((a and b) == [???])
q3 = (((b or d) or (a or d)) == [???])
q4 = ((not b) == [???])
q5 = ((not (a or c)) == [???])
q6 = ((not (a and b)) == [???])
q7 = ((not (not a)) == [???])
q8 = ((not (a and b)) == [???])
q9 = (((not a) or (not b)) == [???]) # q8 and q9 are exactly the same. This identity is called De Morgan's laws.
q10 = (((a or c) and (not (a and c))) == [???]) # This operation is known in computer science as XOR or Exclusive OR.

# This part of the code should not be modified, it is here to give you how many errors you made.
total = 10-sum((q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7, q8, q9, q10))
if total == 0:
    print('You have made no errors ! Congratulations')
else:
    print('You have made ', total, ' errors')</code></pre>

<h3>2 - Simple if statement</h3>

<p>
  Do the following :
  <ol >
    <li>Ask the user to enter a velocity in m/s</li>
    <li>Print an error if the value if negative or if the value is higher than the speed of light (3.0e8)</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Note :</strong> it is possible to specify multiple bounds in a single if, for instance :
</p>
<pre><code>if 0 &lt= a &lt= 1:
print('The value is between 0 and 1 !')</code></pre>

<h3>3 - <code>if - elif - else</code></h3>

<p>
  Write a program that does the following :
  <ol>
    <li>Ask the user to input two values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code></li>
    <li>Depending on their value (and using conditional statements), print the corresponding statement on the screen :
      <ul>
	<li> <code>"a is bigger than b"</code> </li>
	<li> <code>"b is bigger than a"</code> </li>
	<li> <code>"a and b are equal"</code></li>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>


<h3>4 - Taking off</h3>
<p>
  You are part of a NASA team in charge of designing software to help astronauts in their missions. You are assigned a task to write a program to help astronauts to configure their spaceships when taking off exoplanets. For that, they must beat the gravitational attraction of the planet. The attraction is a force which intensity is (roughly) given by the following formula :
</p>

$$ F = G \frac{M}{d^2} $$

<p>
  Where :
  <ul>
    <li> \(G\) is the gravitational constant : \(G \approx 6.67.10^{-11} m^3.kg.s^{-2}\)</li>
    <li> \(M\) is the mass of the planet in \(kg\)</li>
    <li> \(d\) is the distance to the centre of the planet in \(m\)</li>
  </ul>

  Write a program to automatically detect if the spaceship configuration is powerful enough to take off.
</p>

<p>
  For that :
  <ol>
    <li>Ask the user the mass of the planet \(M\)</li>
    <li>Ask the user their curent distance from the centre \(d\)</li>
    <li>Ask the user the propulsion force of their spaceship \(F_p\)</li>
    <li>Compute \(F\) from \(M\) and \(d\).</li>
    <li>Compare \(F\) with the propulsion intensity and print on the screen if the astronaut will be able to take off or not</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Test your program with the following test cases :

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Earth case 1</strong> : Take off is possible</strong>
      <ul>
	<li> \(M = 5.972.10^{24} kg\) </li>
	<li> \(d = 6.371.10^6 m \)</li>
	<li> \(F_p = 10.0 N\)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Earth case 2</strong> : Take off is not possible</strong>
      <ul>
	<li> \(M = 5.972.10^{24} kg\) </li>
	<li> \(d = 6.371.10^6 m \)</li>
	<li> \(F_p = 4.0 N\)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Moon case</strong> : Take off is possible</strong>
      <ul>
	<li> \(M = 7.347.10^{22} kg\) </li>
	<li> \(d = 1.737.10^6 m \)</li>
	<li> \(F_p = 5.0 N\)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Ganymede case</strong> : Take off is not possible</strong>
      <ul>
	<li> \(M = 1.481.10^{23} kg\) </li>
	<li> \(d = 5.262.10^6 m \)</li>
	<li> \(F_p = 1.0 N\)</li>
        
      </ul>
   
</li>
  </ul>
