<H2>Exercise eXtra2: Birthdays in a Class</H2>
</P>

<P>
You may have been told that the chance, or probability, of two or more people in a class of 30 having a birthday on the same day is surprisingly high.  In fact, the chance of this happening is about 70%.
</P>

<P>
In this exercise, your objective is to calculate the probability that two or more people in a class of <TT>c</TT> people have a birthday on the same day.
</P>

<P>
This probability is given by the following equation.
</P>

$$
p=1-\frac{n!}{(n-c)!n^c}
$$

<P>
where <TT>n</TT> is the number of days in a year and <TT>c</TT> is the number of people in a class. (You might like to prove this formula for yourself).
</P>

<p>
There are several reasonable ways of attacking this problem.
