<H2>Exercise 1: Printing to the screen</H2>
</P>


<P>
In Unit 1 you were shown how to print a message to the screen,and
perform some basic calculations.

</P>
<div>
<ol> <li>Write a program to perform some basic operations and print them
to the screen. Find the results for

  <ul>
    <li> An integer divided by an integer</li>
    <li> A floating point divided by a floating point. </li>
    <li> Try doing some arithmetic with python at the interactive
      command prompt by typing <tt>python3</tt> into a terminal. You
      can also use the interactive <tt>ipython3</tt> to interact with
      the python interpreter in the same way.
  </ul>
[Note that python3 returns a floating point for two numbers that are
  not divisible. This is not the case for many programming languages.]

  
  <li>Calculate the result of the following operations in Python:
    <tt class="bluecolor">1+2-3*4/5</tt>
    <ul>
      <li> Look up the precedence of the operations</li>
      <li> Modify the result using parentheses () to prioritise calculations</li>
      <li> Is the result accurate? What has happened to the precision?</li>
	</ul>
  </li>

  <li> Create a file <tt>fibonacci.py</tt> that contains the following
  python code.

    <pre class="bluecolor">
      <code>
	
	#<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci series  </a>
	print("Calculating the Fibonacci series")
	
	a = 0
	b = 1
	
	while b < 20:
		  #print out the current fibonacci series number
		  print(b)
		  #calculate the next term in the series
		  b = a+b
		  #store the previous term in a
		  a = b-a


</code>
</pre>
    Run this code and try and understand what it does. We will come
    back to the while loop in the code later in the course.
  </ol>
</div>

It's time to move on to <a href="unit2.html">unit 2</a>.
