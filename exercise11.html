<h4>Mandelbrot sets</h4>

<div>
This exercise is based on chapter 5
of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/python-for-scientists/E5CBE088065279A607A18673622AD89D">
Python for Scientists</a>. You have met complex numbers in your
Essential mathematics lectures. A complex number $z = x + i y$ can be
represented by a point $(x,y)$ on the plane. To determine if a point
belongs to the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ the result of the iterated
sequence $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$ is examined. We choose $z_0 = 0$, and
set the constant $c$ to the point in the plane we are examining. If
$|z_n|$ remains bounded as $n\rightarrow \infty$ then $c$ lies in
$\mathcal{M}$. One practical result is that if $|z_n|>2$ for some $n$
then $c$ lies outside $\mathcal{M}$.
<ol>
  <li> Write a function that takes an input of a constant value $c$
  and carries out the interation described for up to <code>max_iter =
  256</code> times. It should return the iteration number when
  $|z_n|>2$. Check your function by showing that $1$ is not in
  $\mathcal{M}$ but $i$ (i.e. <code>1j</code>) is. We will call this
  the escape parameter.</li>
  <li> Now let us create a grid of points as we did for our 2-D plots:
    <pre>
      <code>
import numpy as np
xmin, xmax = -2.0, 1.0
ymin, ymax = -1.5, 1.5
nx, ny = 256, 256
xvalues = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, nx)
yvalues = np.linspace(ymin, ymax, ny)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(xvalues, yvalues)
C = X + 1j * Y
      </code>
    </pre>
By using your function create a new array that contains the escape parameter for each point
    in the array.</li>
  <li>
    You can make a plot of the Mandelbrot set using your escape parameter array:
     <pre>
      <code>
from PIL import Image

picture = Image.fromarray(A) # This makes an image of the array "A"
picture.show()
      </code>
    </pre>
</ol>
Have a look at section 5.11 in Python for Scientists, and compare the
vectorised code there with your code.

<h4>Prime Numbers</h4>


<div>
The goal of this exercise, is to write a program to implement
the <i>Sieve of Eratosthenes</i>, a method to determine the prime
numbers. I will describe briefly how the method works, though
referring to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Wikipedia
entry</a> is also helpful.
</div>
<div>
The algorithm works by starting from a list of the first <i>n</i>
integers.  This will then lead to all primes <i>&le;n</i>.  The
number <i>1</i> is immediately discarded from the list, as being a
special case.  The next number is <i>2</i>.  Since it is still in the
list, it must be prime.  All multiples of <i>2</i> are then crossed
off the list. Since they cannot be prime.
</div>
<div>
The next number, after 2, that is still on the list is <i>3</i>.  That
must be prime, but all multiples of <i>3</i> still in the list are
crossed off.  The next number still on the list is <i>5</i>
(because <i>4</i> has already been crossed off). <i>5</i> must
therefore be prime, and all multiples of <i>5</i> are now crossed off,
if they have not already been.  This continues until you have worked
through the whole list (actually you can stop after <i>n/2</i> and
still get the right answer).
</div>
<div>
Write a program which implements this algorithm.

  Well done, you have reached the end of this self-guided course!
