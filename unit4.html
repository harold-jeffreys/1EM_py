<h3>Unit 4: Loops.
</h3>
  
<div>
So far, our example programs have executed each line in turn through
the program until the end of the program is reached. Sometimes it is
useful to be able to go back and use the same parts of code over and
over (e.g. with a new value of a variable) or conditionally execute
code based on some test (e.g. testing if a number a user has typed in
is in a sensible range). There are a few different ways of doing this,
which we will now discuss.
</div>


<h4>while loops</h4>
<div>
The simplest type of loop is a while loop. This is executed while a
particular condition is true. For example you might like to loop over
all lines in a file while there is still data, or continue a
simulation while an end condition has not been met.
</div>
<DIV CLASS="codelink">
  <pre>
  <code>
time  = 0
while time < 10:
     print(time)
     time = time + 1
print("Exited while loop.")
	     </code>
  </pre>
</DIV>
<div>
Note that the block of code that is executed inside the loop is all
indented by the same amount. The next part of the code to be executed
after the loop has finished is not indented.
</div>

<h4>for loops</h4>
<div>
  A more frequently used type of loop is the for loop. In this case we
  have a list of objects to loop over. A simple way to create a list
  is by using
  the <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/"><code>range()</code></a>
  function. If this function is given a single integer as an argument
  then it generates a list of integers starting from 0 upto but not
  including this value. This function creates a list For example:
</div>
<DIV CLASS="codelink">
<pre>
<code>
for x in range(10):
    print("Loop number ", x)

letters = ("a", "b", "c","d")
for x in letters:
    print(x)
 </code>
  </pre>
