<h3>Unit 5: Functions and modules
</h3>

<div>
Functions are self-contained pieces of code that do a specific task
and help structure programs in a neat way, and allow pieces of code to
be more easily re-used in future programs that you write. You have
already met one function -- <code> print()</code>. You can also define
your own functions. Let's say that you are working on a program which
needs to calculate the area of triangles a lot, and you know the
length of the sides of the triangles. You could write a function to
calculate the area, given the length of the sides. Let's see how that
would look. Some points about how the function & program combination
work follow the example:
</div>

<pre>
  <code>
#This gives us access to the sqrt function
from math import sqrt 
# Calculate the area of a triangle, given the side lengths a, b and c
# We make use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron's_formula">Heron's Formula</a>
def  tri_area(a, b, c):
    s = (a+b+c)/2.0
    return sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))

print("Unit equilateral triangle area: ", tri_area(1,1,1))
</code>
</pre>
<div>
  The definition of the function is started by the keyword <code>
  def</code>. The function name then follows this keyword, followed by
  parentheses that enclose the list of arguments -- in this case the
  three numbers <code> a, b </code> and <code> c </code>, and then a
  colon <code>:</code>. The indented block of code is then executed
  when the function is called. If the function returns a value or an
  object, then it is done by using the <code>return</code> keyword. In
  this case returning the area of the triangle.
<div>
	    
<h4>Modules</h4>
<div>
If you have a collection of functions then it can be useful to group
them all together in a module. For example you might have a few
functions that calculate the area of some geometric shapes. Create a
file called <code>areas.py</code>, with a few functions to calculate the
areas of shapes as follows
</div>
<pre>
<code>
#Make the sqrt function available to our module
from math import sqrt 

def  tri_area(a, b, c):
    """This function takes 3 arguments a,b, and c for the lengths of the side
    of a triangle. It then returns the area of the triangle"""

    s = (a+b+c)/2.0
    return sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))

def square_area(a,b):
    """This function takes 2 arguments a, b for the
    lengths of the sides of a square, and returns the area of the
    square"""
    return a*b
</code>
</pre>


  <div>
    Once you have created this module you can use it in another python
    program by importing the functions it contains. You can use the
    statement <code>import areas</code> to import all the contents of this
    module. You can then access the contents of this module as follows

  </div>

  <pre>
<code>
    from areas import *

    print("Area of unit equilateral triangle ", tri_area(1,1,1))
    print("Area of unit square ", square_area(1,1))
    </code>
</pre>


<div>
Some modules contain a lot of content, so it is useful to just import
the parts of the module that you need. This can be done using
the <code> from</code> statement as show below. In this case the
function can be called directly.
</div>

  <pre>
<code>
    from areas import tri_area

    print("Area of unit equilateral triangle ", tri_area(1,1,1))
</code>
</pre>

  <div>
    Note in this example we have only imported the function of the
    calculation of the area of a triangle. If we try and access
    the <code>square_area</code> function then the interpreter will
    complain that the function is not defined.
</div>

  <div>
    We have also included some useful information about what our
    functions do using triple quotes <code>"""</code> at the start of
    the definition. We can access this using the <code>help()</code>
    function available in python. To see this start an instance of the
    python interpreter at the command prompt by typing <code>
    python3</code>. Then import our new module by typing <code> import
    areas</code>. Finally ask for help on our new functions by
    typing <code>help(tri_area)</code>. You should see a print out of
    the text at the start of the function definition. It is good
    programming practice to include this short description
    (doc_string) at the start of your function definitions.
    </div>


  <div>
    A problem that occurs in importing a new module is you might have
    duplicates of the names of your functions -- we might already have
    defined functions using the same name to perform a different
    operation. To avoid this problem we can use <code> import </code> as follows:
    
  <pre>
<code>
    import areas

    print("Area of unit equilateral triangle ", areas.tri_area(3,4,5))
</code>
</pre>

    The functions contained within the areas.py module are now
    accessible only by using the <code>areas.</code> prefix for their
    names. We might like to shorten this prefix, or redefine it completely for convenience, in which case we can use:

    <pre>
<code>
    import areas as A

    print("Area of unit equilateral triangle ", A.tri_area(3,4,5))
</code>
</pre>
    
  </div>
