<H2>Exercise 1: Creating and running programs</H2>
</P>


<P>
In Unit 1 you were shown how to print a message to the screen,and
perform some basic calculations.

</P>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li> You can run python commands in a two different ways. A quick
      way to investigate the effect of commands is to use the invoke
      the interactive python interpreter.
      <ul><li>Open a terminal window, and
	start the python interpreter by typing <tt>ipython3</tt>.
	<li> Enter the print command <code>print("hello world!")</code>
	<li> Define two integers <code> a = 3</code>, and <code> b = 2</code>.
<br>	<em>  [Note that python3 returns a floating point for two numbers that are
  not divisible. This is not the case for many programming languages. If you require integer division then you must use //.]</em>

	<li> Calculate results the division and multiplication of these integers.
	  <li> Now try some basic arithmetic with floating point
	    numbers <code> c = 1.23</code> and <code> d = 3.0e1</code>.
	  <li>	    Calculate the result of the following operations in Python:
	    <code>1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5</code>.
	  <li> Look up the precedence of the operations -- in what
	    order are the operations calculated?
	    <li> Is the result accurate? What has happened to the
	      precision?
	      <li> Check the type of your variables using
	      the <code>type()</code> function.
    </ul>

  <li> Now we will use python by running it on a file containing a
  program. Create a file <tt>fibonacci.py</tt> that contains the
  following python code.

   <pre>
    <code>
#<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci series  </a>
print("Calculating the Fibonacci series")
	
a = 0
b = 1
	
while b < 20:
	  #print out the current fibonacci series number
	  print(b)
	  #calculate the next term in the series
	  b = a + b
	  #store the previous term in a
	  a = b - a
	 
</code>
   </pre>
   Run this program by typing <tt>run fibonacci.py</tt> in the
   ipython3 interpreter. Try to understand what it does. We will
   return to loops later in the course.
  </ol>
</div>

<P>
When you have understood these exercises it's time to move on to <a href="unit2.html">unit 2</a>.
